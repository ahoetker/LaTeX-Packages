    \section{Showing off some features}

    Let's see some useful tricks! To start, I love the \texttt{siunitx} package, but it doesn't always have the US engineering units I need! With the custom units defined in my packages, I can now state with confidence that \SI{1}{\cfm} is equal to \SI{0.471947}{\liter\per\second}.

    \section{Adding some citations}

    One of the best features of the \LaTeX\ document system is citation management. By citing some irrelevant heat transfer papers \autocite{bohnetFoulingHeatTransfer1987,prabhanjanComparisonHeatTransfer2002}, we can see how our citations and bibliography are styled \autocite{wongLogMeanHeat2009}.
